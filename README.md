Code files for Python-Machine-Learning-Cookbook Based on Python 3.x

This project based on the code from "https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Machine-Learning-Cookbook"

I tested those codes and adjust some of them in order to make sure they can run correctly on my computer with Python 3.6.1.

If you are also a reader of this book(Python-Machine-Learning-Cookbook), I am willing to share those codes with you.
